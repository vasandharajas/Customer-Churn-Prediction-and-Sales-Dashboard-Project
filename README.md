Customer Churn Prediction and Sales Dashboard

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The Customer Churn Prediction and Sales Dashboard project leverages Data Analytics and Machine Learning to analyze customer behavior, predict churn probability, and visualize sales trends. This system is designed for businesses, e-commerce platforms, and service providers to enhance customer retention and optimize sales strategies.


ðŸš€ Key Features
Data Acquisition & Preprocessing.
Collect customer data from CRM systems, sales databases, and user interaction logs.
Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations.
Handle missing values, normalize numerical data, and encode categorical variables.
Feature engineering: purchase frequency, engagement scores, subscription tenure.

Churn Prediction Models:
Supervised Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM
Deep Learning: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential churn analysis
